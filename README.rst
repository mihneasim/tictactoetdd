TicTacToe by TDD+
============================

This was written by pair programming with dserban_
in two sessions of about 30 mins each, at
*TDD as if you meant it* event_.

The purpose of this exercise was to learn real test driven development:
make your design emerge from writing tests. Implement the target software
by isolating redundant code in the implementation inside the test.
